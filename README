This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Karl Cassel (kcassel@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Wesly Lim (welim@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Karl Cassel spent __5.5__ hours working alone.
Wesly Lim spent __5__ hours working alone.
We spent __20__ hours working together.
Karl Cassel spent _9_ hours driving.
Wesly Lim spent _11_ hours driving.
